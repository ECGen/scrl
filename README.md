  the saxicole (lichen and moss) community on rocks under the canopy
  of the trees. 
- The project is written in RMarkdown notebook format, which you can
  render and browse.
- If you would like to run the code and/or add-on and re-build and
  render a new version of the project, you can use the
  ![rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package.
