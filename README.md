Sunset Crater Rock Lichen/Moss Project
======================================

- This is an analysis of the effect of Pinyon Pine tree traits on
  the saxicole (lichen and moss) community on rocks under the canopy
  of the trees. 
- The project is written in RMarkdown notebook format, which you can
  browse via *scrl_report.html* or *scrl_report.md*. 
- If you would like to run the code and/or add-on and re-build and
  render a new version of the project, you can use the
  !(https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)[rmarkdown] package. 
  
```{r}

install.packages("rmarkdown")
rmarkdown::render("scrl_report.Rmd")

```
